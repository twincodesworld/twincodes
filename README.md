# twincodes
The present codes is about a new cryptographic algorithm with the goal of introduce, criticize and review that is publicly released.
Twincodes is the name of a new encryption algorithm that can completely encrypt any type of file.
I am not a professional coder, and this codes is only related to the test code for the Twincodes algorithm.
Non-standard naming and non-commenting, makes it hard to read codes quickly and I apologize for this.
But note that these codes are for the sole purpose of displaying and proving the function of the Twincodes algorithm and is not a standard code for citation,so each person can create standardized and optimized codes based on the algorithm published on the www.twincodesworld.com (For a better understanding of the current code, you should refer to the published algorithm.)
It is hoped that criticism and attention will be made and its bugs and possible errors will be resolved.
